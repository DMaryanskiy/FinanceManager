GREETINGS: Hi! I'm a bot which can help you to manage your expenses and income! To know more about my commands type /help.

HELP: |
        Here's a short user guide for me:
        1. Choose a currency. Each currency is a unique wallet with its own balance, limits, expenses and incomes. Just type /currency.
        2. Check your balance and limits. Just type /balance.
        3. Check all available categories. Just type /category.
        4. After you've chosen a currency you may add your expenses and incomes. Just type a message consisting of three words - type of transaction, amount of money and a category. It may look like "expense 2 coffee" or "income 2400 salary".
        5. You may also check your statistics with all your expenses and incomes. Just type /statistics.
        6. You may update your limits after choosing a currency. Just type a message like "update 40 daily".
